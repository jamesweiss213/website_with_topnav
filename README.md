Make sure

1.) You properly link the stylesheet
and change the path. It's currently set
to css/styles.css as the href, but I didn't
make a css folder in this github Dropbox.
Idk why but I was having difficulties
uploading a folder. Probably on me
2.) Doesn't work on phone with the proper
Desktop pathing. Maybe making pathing work
on the phone is different.
